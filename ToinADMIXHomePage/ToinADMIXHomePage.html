                <h2>"What is RCJ?"</h2>
                    <p> <br> "RCJ" is the abbreviation for <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/">"RoboCupJunior"</a>,
                        and has its leagus <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/">Soccer</a> and <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/rescue/">Rescue</a>. <br><br>
                    We have participated in the "Lightweight" league since 2022.<br><br>
                    RCJ is held in many countries and all of the 14 to 19-year-old students can participate the competition. <br><br>
                    Lightweight is one of the Soccer Leagues with a special electronic ball. <br><br>
                    It has some <a href="https://robocup-junior.github.io/soccer-rules/master/rules.pdf">rules</a> for robots' sizes, weights, and their moves.

                <h2>"What do we do?"</h2>
                    <h3>Making Robots</h3>
                        <p>We try to make better robots to do what we want, following the regulations. <br><br>
                        The regulation is about robots' sizes, weights, and the sensors they have. <br><br>
                        Robots which don't satisfy the regulations cannot be used. <br><br>
                        However, to win the game, we need some heavy and big parts such as kickers, dribblers, etc.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                        <p>After making our robots, we write programs to let them play socceer in the rules. <br><br>
                            At first, every robots mustn't hit the walls. If they do so, they have to be out from the game for 30 seconds. <br><br>
                            Also, not to lose the direct of the opponents' goal, robots need to fix thier postures. <br><br>
                            Then, they chase the ball.
